## 🚀 Project Overview

**From Friends to Features** is a social data analysis project built on raw data collected from friends, their mutual connections, and the pages they engage with. The goal of the project is to understand how **social proximity and shared interests** can be used to generate meaningful recommendations.

By cleaning, processing, and analyzing real-world social data, this project demonstrates how connections and preferences can be translated into features that reveal **potential friendships and interest-based recommendations**.
